## Installation

For Debian and Ubuntu server, the Zabbix Frontend modules are usually placed in ``/usr/share/zabbix/modules/``.

Copy the folder `modules/csv-host-importer` to `/usr/share/zabbix/modules/csv-host-importer` on the Zabbix frontend web server.

Then go to `Administration`, `General`, `Modules`, click `Scan directory` and enable the new module in the list.

## Usage

Once the frontend module is activated, a new menu entry `Host CSV Importer` should appear under `Configuration`.

You can download an example CSV file from there or use the [example.csv](./example.csv) from the repo and edit the list to your liking.

Here is a list of supported CSV columns:

| Name         | Purpose                                                      | Optional |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| NAME         | Host name.                                                   | ❌        |
| VISIBLE_NAME | Host visible name.                                           | ✔        |
| HOST_GROUPS  | List of host group names, separated by a comma. Missing host groups are created automatically. | ❌        |
| TEMPLATES    | List of template names to assign to the host, separated by a comma. Templates must exist with the specified name. | ✔        |
| AGENT_IP     | Interface: Zabbix Agent IP address.                          | ✔        |
| AGENT_DNS    | Interface: Zabbix Agent DNS name.                            | ✔        |
| SNMP_IP      | Interface: SNMP IP address.                                  | ✔        |
| SNMP_DNS     | Interface: SNMP DNS name.                                    | ✔        |
| SNMP_VERSION | Interface: SNMP version number (1, 2 or 3).                  | ✔        |
| DESCRIPTION  | Host description field.                                      | ✔        |

Additional hints:

* The columns are case-insensitive, so ``NAME``, ``name`` and ``NaMe`` are all valid.
* The columns must be in the first line of the CSV file.
* The separator character must be ";".

The CSV file can then be imported in the same menu entry. You get a chance to preview the host list before the actual import.
